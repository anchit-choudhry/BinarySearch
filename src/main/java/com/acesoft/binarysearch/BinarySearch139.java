 * https://binarysearch.com/problems/Consecutive-Duplicates
 *
 * Given a string s, consisting of "X" and "Y"s, delete the minimum number of characters such that
 * there's no consecutive "X" and no consecutive "Y".
 *
 * Constraints
 * n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
 *
 * Example 1
 * Input
 * s = "YYYXYXX"
 * Output
 * "YXYX"
 * Explanation
 * One solution is to delete the first two "Y"s and the last "X".
